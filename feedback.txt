Feedback on scanning and parsing lab 

My name is: Arthur Lunn

My account number is: all3187

What did I learn?

 - It seems like it's a lot easier to program a prefix calculator but this
   may just be a result of doing it second.

How far did I get in this lab?

 - Finished all three main parts.

 - Tried the bonus:
        > it should accept "{ for x=1 x<3 x=x+1 { y=x*2 } }"
        > The syntax is "{ for assignment condition statement block }"
        > It appears all the compiler is doing is parsing out the elements of the statements
        > While the if then statement had multiple blocks the For loop does not so 
          labeling the blocks was not necesary.



What did I have problems with?

 - Part 2 was really hard. It's difficult to figure out what element is
   causing the shift/reduce && reduce/reduce errors since MAKE doesn't give
   any indication


What can the instructor do to improve this lab?

 - It's unclear what the program should do when given an "illegal" input.



What would you have liked to do in this lab?

 - Nothing extra I would have liked to do.


Anything else you would like to tell me:

 - I assumed that an "illegal" input (part 3) it should generate a syntax 
   error.
